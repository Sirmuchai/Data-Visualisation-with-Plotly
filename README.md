### Problem Statement
In this project, you are a data journalist for a renowned publication. Your editor in chief has given
you access to a database that addresses a range of topics. You will be writing a 500 to
800-word article about the topic of your choosing.
Your editor will curate the best articles from your cohort of data journalists and publish them.

You will be solving for one of the following questions:
* What is a high-level diagnosis of the sector you’re studying?
* What are the key facts people need to know about this sector?
* What are key trends that are worth noting? You are welcome to do a little research to
correlate these with trends with events or facts about the sector as long as you remain
objective.
* What recommendations would you have for the sector in question? These need to be
based on the database.
